# OAU Campus Navigation WebGIS

## 📌 Project Overview
This project addresses the challenges of campus navigation at **Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU)** by developing a **web-based Geographic Information System (WebGIS)** application. The platform enables users to search for locations, view detailed spatial information, and generate optimal routes across the university campus through an interactive and user-friendly interface.

The application integrates spatial and attribute data into a functional geodatabase and delivers fast, accurate, and intuitive navigation for students, staff, and visitors.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop a centralized WebGIS platform for campus navigation at OAU  
- Integrate spatial and attribute data into a structured geodatabase  
- Enable interactive location search, routing, and map visualization  
- Provide a responsive and efficient system accessible via web browsers  

---

## 🗺 Data Collection & Processing
The study involved the collection, processing, and integration of spatial datasets representing key campus features, including:

- **115 Points of Interest (POIs)**  
- **1,346 Residential Units**  
- **Road Network Data**  
- **Administrative Boundaries**

All datasets were cleaned, structured, and integrated into a **geodatabase** to support spatial queries, routing, and map rendering.

## ⚡ Performance Evaluation
The system demonstrated strong performance across multiple metrics:

| Metric | Result |
|------|-------|
| Query Response Time | **0.12 – 0.18 seconds** |
| Routing Accuracy | **96%** |
| Average Map Load Time | **1.8 seconds** |

---

## 🧪 Usability Testing
Usability evaluation was conducted with **35 participants**, yielding the following results:

- **System Usability Scale (SUS) Score:** 84  
- **Task Success Rate:** 94%  

These results indicate a **high level of user satisfaction** and ease of use.
